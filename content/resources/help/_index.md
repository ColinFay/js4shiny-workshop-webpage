There are a few ways to connect with the workshop team and community during the workshop.

## <i class="fas fa-comments"></i> Gitter Chat Room

[gitter]: https://gitter.im/js4shiny/rstudio-conf-2020

<i class="fab fa-gitter"></i> [chat.js4shiny.com](https://chat.js4shiny.com)

For quick questions and comments,
you can [chat online][gitter] at our Gitter rstudio::conf community room.

This is a great place to ask quick questions,
connect with others in the workshop,
and get in touch with a TA.

## <i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> GitHub Issues

[js-for-shiny]: https://github.com/rstudio-conf-2020/js-for-shiny
[js4shiny-pkg]: https://github.com/gadenbuie/js4shiny

<i class="fab fa-github"></i> [rstudio-conf-2020/js-for-shiny][js-for-shiny]

If you have a question about workshop materials,
need help locating a resource,
or find an error or typo,
you can open an issue in the [workshop Github repo][js-for-shiny].

<i class="fab fa-github"></i> [gadenbuie/js4shiny](https://github.com/gadenbuie/js4shiny/issues)

If you have a question or encounter an error with the [js4shiny package](https://pkg.js4shiny.com),
